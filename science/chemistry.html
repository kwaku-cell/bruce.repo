            <h2>Introduction to Chemistry</h2>
            <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that studies the composition, structure, properties, and changes of matter. It is often referred to as the "central science" because it connects other natural sciences like physics, biology, and geology. Chemistry plays a vital role in our daily lives, from the food we eat to the medicines we take and the materials we use.</p>

            <h2>History of Chemistry</h2>
            <p>The history of chemistry dates back to ancient times when early civilizations used chemical processes like fermentation and metallurgy. The field evolved significantly during the Middle Ages with the rise of alchemy, which laid the groundwork for modern chemistry. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the development of key theories and discoveries, such as the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev and the atomic theory by John Dalton.</p>
