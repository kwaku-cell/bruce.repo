    <section id="principles">
        <h2>Fundamental Principles of Physics</h2>
        <p>Physics is built on a foundation of fundamental principles, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Newton's Laws of Motion:</strong> These laws describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it.</li>
            <li><strong>Thermodynamics:</strong> The study of heat, energy, and work, and how they interact.</li>
            <li><strong>Electromagnetism:</strong> The study of electric and magnetic fields and their interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Quantum Mechanics:</strong> The study of the behavior of matter and energy on the atomic and subatomic scale.</li>
            <li><strong>Relativity:</strong> Einstein's theories of special and general relativity, which describe the behavior of objects in high-speed and gravitational environments.</li>
        </ul>
