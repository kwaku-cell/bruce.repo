        <h2>History of Basketball</h2>
        <p>Basketball was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a physical education instructor in Springfield, Massachusetts. He created the game as a way to keep his students active indoors during the winter months. The first game was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets as goals.</p>
        <p>Over the years, basketball evolved into a global sport, with the establishment of professional leagues like the NBA (National Basketball Association) and international competitions such as the Olympics. Today, basketball is played by millions of people worldwide, from school gyms to professional arenas.</p>

        <h2>Rules of Basketball</h2>
        <p>Basketball is played between two teams of five players each. The objective is to score points by shooting the ball through the opponent's hoop. Here are some basic rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The game is played in four quarters, each lasting 10-12 minutes depending on the league.</li>
            <li>Players can dribble, pass, or shoot the ball, but they cannot take more than two steps without dribbling.</li>
            <li>Each successful shot inside the three-point line earns two points, while shots beyond the line earn three points.</li>
            <li>The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.</li>
        </ul>
