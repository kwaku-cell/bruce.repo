        <h2>History of the Olympics</h2>
        <p>The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece around 776 BC in Olympia. These games were held in honor of Zeus, the king of the Greek gods, and featured athletic competitions such as running, wrestling, and chariot racing. The ancient Olympics were a unifying event for the Greek city-states, fostering a sense of shared culture and identity.</p>

        <p>After the decline of ancient Greece, the Olympics were discontinued. However, the spirit of the games was revived in the late 19th century by Pierre de Coubertin, who founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896.</p>
