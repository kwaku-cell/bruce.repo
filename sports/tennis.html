        <h2>History of Tennis</h2>
        <p>Tennis is a sport with a rich history that dates back to the 12th century in France. Originally played with the palm of the hand, it evolved into the modern game we know today. The first official tennis tournament, Wimbledon, was held in 1877 in England, and it remains one of the most prestigious events in the sport.</p>

        <h2>Rules of Tennis</h2>
        <p>Tennis is played on a rectangular court divided by a net. Players use a racket to hit a ball over the net into the opponent's court. Points are scored when the opponent fails to return the ball within the boundaries. Matches can be played as singles (one-on-one) or doubles (two-on-two).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A match is typically played in best-of-three or best-of-five sets.</li>
            <li>Each set is won by the first player to win six games with a margin of at least two games.</li>
            <li>The scoring system progresses as follows: 0 (Love), 15, 30, 40, and Game.</li>
        </ul>
